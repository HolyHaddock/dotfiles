XMonad configuration
--------------------

This should be checked out to `~/.xmonad/`. `xmonad.hs` can then be used as-is. Everything else will need symlinking into the right place.

Symlinks
========

`.xmobarrc` should be symlinked to `~/.xmobarrc`

`wallpaper.sh` needs to be on `$PATH` on startup, I've got mine in `/usr/local/bin`

Wallpaper.sh
============

Expects to find wallpapers as a bunch of .jpg or .png files in `~/Dropbox/wallpapers`.
